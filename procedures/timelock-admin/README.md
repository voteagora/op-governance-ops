# Timelock Proposal Lister

This script identifies and displays proposals in Optimism's Timelock contract by analyzing historical events and current contract state. It can show pending, cancelled, or executed proposals.

## Requirements

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) - This script uses Foundry's `cast` tool
- Bash shell environment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/voteagora/op-governance-ops.git
```

2. Move to the directory:
```bash
cd op-governance-ops/procedures/timelock-admin
```

## Usage

```bash
./list-timelock-proposals.sh [timelock_address] [--rpc-url <rpc_url>] [--type <type>] [--help]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `timelock_address` | The address of the `TimelockController` contract | 0x0eDd4B2cCCf41453D8B5443FBB96cc577d1d06bF |
| `--rpc-url <url>` | The RPC endpoint URL to use | https://rpc.ankr.com/optimism |
| `--type <type>` | Type of proposals to display: pending, cancelled, or executed | pending |
| `--help` | Display help information | - |

## How It Works

The script:

1. Fetches all `CallScheduled`, `Cancelled`, and `CallExecuted` events from the `TimelockController`
2. Decodes the event data to extract details about each proposal
3. Processes OP token transfers to identify the amount at risk
4. Checks the current state of each proposal via the contract
5. Filters proposals based on the specified type (pending, cancelled, executed)
6. Displays detailed information including status, timestamps, and token amounts

## Example Output

```
> ./list-timelock-proposals.sh

```

## Viewing Different Types of Proposals

The script can display three different types of proposals:

### Pending Proposals

```bash
./list-timelock-proposals.sh --type pending
```

Shows operations that have been scheduled but not yet executed or cancelled. For each pending proposal, it shows the time remaining until it's ready for execution or indicates if it's already ready.

### Cancelled Proposals

```bash
./list-timelock-proposals.sh --type cancelled
```

Shows operations that were scheduled but later cancelled before execution.

### Executed Proposals

```bash
./list-timelock-proposals.sh --type executed
```

Shows operations that have been successfully executed in the timelock.

## OP Token Detection

The script automatically detects operations that interact with the OP token:

- It identifies ERC20 transfers with function selector `0xa9059cbb`
- It decodes the recipient address and transfer amount
- It displays the amount of OP tokens at risk in a human-readable format

## Limitations

- The script starts checking from block 105235063, which is the deployment block of the Timelock contract.
- The script cannot decode all types of function calls, but it provides special handling for OP token transfers
- The default RPC is public, so it might occasionally be slow, unresponsive or rate-limited
